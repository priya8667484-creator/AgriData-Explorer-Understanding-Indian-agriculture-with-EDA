# AgriData-Explorer-Understanding-Indian-agriculture-with-EDA
AgriData Explorer is an EDA-based project that analyzes Indian agriculture data to identify crop production, yield, and area trends across states and years. Using SQL and Power BI, it converts raw data into interactive insights for better agricultural understanding.
🌾 AgriData Explorer: Understanding Indian Agriculture with EDA
📌 Project Description

AgriData Explorer is a data analytics project designed to explore and understand patterns, trends, and insights in Indian agriculture using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques. The project analyzes historical crop production data across different states, districts, years, and crops to identify key agricultural trends and performance indicators.

The dataset includes information such as area cultivated, total production, and yield for major crops like rice, wheat, maize, cotton, oilseeds, and groundnut. By applying SQL queries, data cleaning, and visualization techniques, the project transforms raw agricultural data into meaningful insights that support data-driven understanding of Indian agriculture.
EDA techniques are used to:

Examine year-wise and state-wise crop production trends

Identify top-performing states and districts

Analyze yield variations and growth patterns

Compare production performance across crops

Detect patterns related to cultivated area and output

The processed data is stored in a MySQL database, queried using SQL, and visualized through Power BI interactive dashboards, allowing users to dynamically explore agricultural trends using filters and slicers.

🎯 Objectives of the Project

To perform exploratory data analysis on Indian agriculture data

To identify production and yield trends across crops and regions

To compare agricultural performance between states and districts

To create interactive Power BI reports and dashboards

To support data-driven insights for agricultural analysis
